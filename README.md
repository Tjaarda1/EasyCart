Make your shopping list cost less!

Project made for mobile apps class. The app's idea is that the user scans his shopping tickets, and saves the prices of the items in every visited supermarket.

Later the user can make a shopping list and this app will show where the cheapest supermarket is.

Project code, idea, name, logo and design are made by me, and is under the MIT License of open source code.
